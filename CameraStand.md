So... The thesis is:

- 3D printing is cool. It is possible to create cool things, like chess pieces. However, even though those things are cool, they are not 
necesarily useful.
- 3D printed things that are assembeled together with screws, glue, etc, suddenly become useful. Add a motor and a microontroller, 
and they are more useful. That's not the point, however, the point is that even without a motor, there can be useful stuff.

So what is an example of a thing to illustrate this? A camera stand. If can be created from PVC pipes and 3D printed things.
Camera stands are usually quite expensive, this way it should be possible to create a camera stand for $5 or so. Which is cheap, I think.

This is to validate that it is actually possible to create useful things with 3D printing. It will prove that this is the case by
showing that a camera stand can actually make it in the open and free market, competine with all the other camera stands out there.
