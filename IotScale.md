IoT Scale

This is a generalization of another problem.

The problem is the automatic bee hive.

Instead of making a connected bee hive, let's just make a connected scale.
A scale is a more generic thing.

The features will be:
  - The "thing" can connect to the internet.
  - We need to create a UI inside it to manage the connection. Chance to test.
  - 

It's not so small actually.

Accompanied by a Wordpress plugin so data can be collected. This is also a generic thing.

Using the scale and wordpress plugin (generic) we can build a website to manage bee hives (specific).
