I just got an email from Wikipedia asking for a donation. I would be happy to donate, but I would be even happier if I could
show off to my friends that I'm a Proud Wikipedia Donor. Preferably this should be verifiable with a cryptographic proof.

I.e. the "badge" or whatever I would get should serve 2 purposes:

1. It should look good and cool, so I don't mind it showing up on my facebook page or other social media page.
2. It should have a function as well. If someone clicks on the badge, it should be clear that it is 100% cryptographically verified
that it is actually I who made the donation.

So this can be done by an external service. The service would offer donations by cryptocurrency to various organisations.
Since it is done using crypto, it will be possible to achieve the functionality of the verification. The business model for the service
would be to take a comission on the donated amount (0.1% - 1% or so).
