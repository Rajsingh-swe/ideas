IoT Lock

This is about creating a lock that is conected to the blockchain. Think of a bicycle lock, with a display and a keypad on it. 
Maybe not a keypad, but a rotary encoder knob thingy. The important thing is that it should be possible to enter a key.

The person who owns the thing that the lock locks, has the ability to change the code to open it. The lock doesn't need to
be constantly connected to the internet, but it needs to connect the on occasion and get new code data / ownership data. Maybe
every 30 days. If more than 30 days have passed, it refuses to open, and it says "please give me an internet connection".

The ownership is then on the blockchain. Probably ethereum. It can be transferred/sold etc. Ideally there should be a 
nice user interface for this.
