# Tiny Makerspace

In the spirit of tiny houses. Create a makerspace on wheels, with 3D printer CNC router etc, and go on a tour in Europe. Like a
"bookmodile 2.0". It is not lending books, though. The point is to inspire eople and show that it is possible to create technology
yourself that can help you live off grid.

It can be make financially self sustaining. By offering courses on making and hacking. Also by selling components that makers need.

The whole tine makerspace should be "self replicating". So if it comes to a town, the people in the town can then create their own tiny
makerspace. If they want to, they can take their makerspace on tour as well, and the message is spread further.
